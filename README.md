# Neural Image Captioning

Image Captioning using advanced Computer Vision and Natural language processing methods. Implemented VGG-16 Net Convolutional Neural Network for extracting 4096-Dimensional feature vector & LSTM for novel sentence generation in natural language. Trained the model on Flickr8k dataset and obtained BLEU Score at par with state-of-the-art papers which uses a similiar implementation.
